Applicable Licenses
Unless otherwise indicated, all Content made available by the
TOPCASED project is provided to you under the terms and conditions
of the Eclipse Public License Version 1.0 (&quot;EPL&quot;). A copy of
the EPL is provided with this Content and is also available at
http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html. For purposes of the
EPL, &quot;Program&quot; will mean the Content.
Content includes, but is not limited to, source code, object
code, documentation and other files maintained in the TOPCASED
CVS repository (&quot;Repository&quot;) in CVS modules (&quot;Modules&quot;) and
made available as downloadable archives (&quot;Downloads&quot;).
* Content may be structured and packaged into modules to facilitate
delivering, extending, and upgrading the Content. Typical modules
may include plug-ins (&quot;Plug-ins&quot;), plug-in fragments (&quot;Fragments&quot;),
and features (&quot;Features&quot;).
* Each Plug-in or Fragment may be packaged as a sub-directory
or
JAR (Javaâ„¢ ARchive) in a directory named &quot;plugins&quot;.
* A Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or Fragments
and associated material. Each Feature may be packaged as a sub-directory
in a directory named &quot;features&quot;. Within a Feature, files named
&quot;feature.xml&quot; may contain a list of the names and version numbers
of the Plug-ins and/or Fragments associated with that Feature.
* Features may also include other Features (&quot;Included Features&quot;).
Within a Feature, files named &quot;feature.xml&quot; may contain a list
of the names and version numbers of Included Features.
The terms and conditions governing Plug-ins and Fragments should
be contained in files named &quot;about.html&quot; (&quot;Abouts&quot;). The terms
and conditions governing Features and Included Features should
be contained in files named &quot;license.html&quot; (&quot;Feature Licenses&quot;).
Abouts and Feature Licenses may be located in any directory of
a Download or Module including, but not limited to the following
locations:
* The top-level (root) directory
* Plug-in and Fragment directories
* Inside Plug-ins and Fragments packaged as JARs
* Sub-directories of the directory named &quot;src&quot; of certain Plug-ins
* Feature directories
Note: if a Feature made available by the TOPCASED project is
installed using the Eclipse Update Manager, you must agree to
a license (&quot;Feature Update License&quot;) during the installation
process. If the Feature contains Included Features, the Feature
Update License should either provide you with the terms and conditions
governing the Included Features or inform you where you can locate
them. Feature Update Licenses may be found in the &quot;license&quot; property
of files named &quot;feature.properties&quot; found within a Feature. Such
Abouts, Feature Licenses, and Feature Update Licenses contain
the terms and conditions (or references to such terms and conditions)
that govern your use of the associated Content in that directory.
THE ABOUTS, FEATURE LICENSES, AND FEATURE UPDATE LICENSES MAY
REFER TO THE EPL OR OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS, NOTICES OR TERMS
AND CONDITIONS. SOME OF THESE OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS MAY INCLUDE
(BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO):
* Common Public License Version 1.0 (available at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl-v10.html)
* Apache Software License 1.1 (available at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE)
* Apache Software License 2.0 (available at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
